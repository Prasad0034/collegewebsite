    <p style="font-size: large;">One of the most popular and commonly pursued streams in senior secondary school is the Non-Medical stream. 
       Also referred to as MPC subjects, this stream lets you dive into the non-medical side of the domain of Science.
       The MPC full form in intermediate studies is Maths, Physics, and Chemistry, thus, it puts thrust on these three
       main areas. With a diverse curriculum, MPC subjects offer a wide range of career opportunities to explore. Architecture,
       Engineering, Defence Services, Commercial pilot, Statistics, Industrial Designing and Data Analytics are some of the few
       professions you can strive for.</p>
